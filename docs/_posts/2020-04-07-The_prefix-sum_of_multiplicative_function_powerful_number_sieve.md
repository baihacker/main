# Method description
Consider computing the prefix-sum of a multiplicative function $f$, the prefix-sum is given by cal(index, n). Index is the smallest number where the prime[index] * prime[index] > n. (index starts from 0)

```cpp
int64 cal(int64 i, int64 n) {
  int64 ret = sg(n);
  for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
    int64 p = plist[j], m = n / p / p;
    if (m == 0) break;
    for (int k = 2; m >= 1; ++k, m /= p) if (h(k) != 0) {
      ret += h(k) * cal(j, m);
    }
  }
  return ret;
}
```

* The definition of f and g will be discussed in a later section.
* sg is the prefix-sum of g.
* plist[i] is the $i_{th}$ prime (index starts from 0).

This method can be viewed as $\sum_{p \text{ is powerful or 1}}h(p)sg(\frac{n}{p})$ and that’s why we call it powerful number sieving.

# Find f and g
To find multiplicative function $h,g$, consider their definitions on $p^k$ (p is prime) we have $f(p^k) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k}h(p^i)g(p^{k-i})$.
Then, we have the way to
* Find $g$
  * We can start from $f(p) = g(p)$.
* Find $h$
  * In the method, we skip $p^2$, to make sure it is correct, we add a forced constraints $h(p)=0$.
  * For $k \ge 2$, we can get the value of $h(p^k)$ by solving an equation since $g$ is found and $h(p^i)$ is known for $i < k$.

# Complexity
By the view of powerful number sieving, since a powerful number can be represented as $a^3b^2$, it is easy to see the complexity is $\iint_{x,y}O_{sg}(\frac{n}{x^3y^2})dx\,dy$, so the complexity is

$$
\begin{cases}n^{1/2}&O_{sg} \text{ is smaller than } n^{1/2}\\n^{1/2}\log{n}&O_{sg} \text{ is  } n^{1/2}\\O_{sg}&O_{sg} \text{ is larger than } n^{1/2}\end{cases}
$$

So, if we want to make use of this method, another constraint on $g$ is that we can compute $sg$ fast.

*Note: we assume that $h(p^k)$ can be computed in a reasonable complexity.*

# Further thoughts
## Reach n^(⅓)
If we have $h(p)=h(p^2)=0$, we may have an algorithm of complexity around $n^{\frac{1}{3}}$. But meanwhile, another constraint is added on $g$, $f(p^2)=g(p^2)$. The challenges are
* Can we find it?
* Can we compute sg in a reasonable complexity.
* Since $f(p^k)=g(p^k)$ for $k<=2$, they are too similar. We want to reduce the complexity of computing sf but g is similar to f, so can we reduce a lot if they are too similar?

## Similarity rank and complexities
We can define the similarity rank of two multiplicative functions by the maximum k such that $f(p^i)=g(p^i)$ if $i\le k$

A question is, how does the similarity rank affect the prefix-sum computation complexity of f and g? More concrete: if k is given, what’s the maximum complexity we can reduce?

If we only consider polynomial complexity, it can be rephased as finding

$$
\max\{cf-cg | \text{complexity of } f=O(n^{cf}), \text{complexity of } g=O(n^{cg})\}
$$

where f is given and the similarity rank of f and g is k.

The following parts are **deprecated**, and they are rephased by [**The prefix-sum of multiplicative function: Dirichlet convolution**](http://baihacker.github.io/main/){:target="_blank"}.

## ~~If h(p) != 0~~
~~$\sum\limits_{p \text{ is powerful or 1}}h(p)sg(\frac{n}{p})$becomes$\sum_{p}h(p)sg(\frac{n}{p})$, we only need the value of $sg(i), sh(i), sg(\frac{n}{i}), sh(\frac{n}{i}), i \le n^{1/2}$. Let $O(n^{\frac{a}{b}})=\max(O(sh), O(sg))$ (usually, we have $0\le a<b$). So, based on $\int _1^nx^{\frac{a}{b}}+(\frac{n}{x})^{\frac{a}{b}}dx$, the complexity is $O(n^{\frac{a+b}{2b}})$. For example $a=1,b=2$, the complexity is $O(n^{\frac{3}{4}})$. When $a=0$, the lower bound is $\Omega (n^{\frac{1}{2}})$. This lower bound is consistent with our intuition, i.e. we need to iterate $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$ function values.~~

~~This analysis also works for $h(p)=0$, in which we only iterate on powerful numbers, so the complexity or the complexity constant will be smaller.~~

~~Compared to the analysis of powerful number sieving, $h(p) \ne 0$ requires that both $sg,sh$ have a good complexity while the powerful number sieving depends on the value of $sg$ on $O (n^{\frac{1}{2}})$ inputs and the value of $h$ on  $O (n^{\frac{1}{2}})$ inputs. Since $h$ is considered to have a better complexity than $sh$, the powerful number sieving has a better performance.~~

~~Another view is that we shift the complexity of $sh$ to $h$’s definition on square free numbers (excluding 1), i.e. 0.~~

## ~~More general approach~~
~~As mentioned by fjzzq2002 [1], $f(p^k) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k}h(p^i)g(p^{k-i})$ can be viewed as the Dirichlet convolution of g and h. So, we can have a general approach to reduce complexity of compute the prefix-sum of a multiplicative function to represent it as the Dirichlet convolution of two other functions and consider how to compute based on the convolution format.~~

~~We have already had an example which is aligned to this approach: mobius inversion. I have another article [5] written in chinese which tries to generalize mobius inversion. It also considers finding the convolution representation, and discussing some ideas/guidance about how to use the convolution to reduce the complexity.~~

~~Overall speaking, the method in this article and mobius inversion are unified in this sense.~~
